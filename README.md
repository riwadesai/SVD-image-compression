# SVD-image-compression
Consider a black-and-white image file (in .jpg format) and use library function in Python or MATLAB to convert it to a matrix (A). Then apply singular value decomposition through power method to AtA (or AtA) to compress it. In order to compress do either of the following:
(i) Compute required number of singular values and vectors so that 75% information remain.
(ii) Compute top 30 singular values and vectors.
Finally reconstruct the compressed image matrix from this singular values
and vectors and use a library function to reconstruct the image again.
